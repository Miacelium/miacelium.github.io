            <h2>Hello! I'm Miacelium and this is my personal blog.</h2>
            <p class="content">
                I'm a biology student and a nerd. Here I'll post about my hobbies such as
                general biology but more specifically microbiology and entomology but also
                linux and programming. I'm by no means professional in any of these topics
                I just enjoy reading about and tinkering with them.<br>
                My posts will mostly entail me trying out things and logging my failures.
                The main point is that logging helps me memorize my knowledge, and I'm an
                attention-whore.

            <h2>How to disable Firefox DRM message</h2>
            <p class="content">
                In order to disable Mozilla Firefox from showing:
                <q>You must enable DRM to play some audio or video on this page. Learn more</q>
                followed by a button to enable DRM in the Firefox settings,<br>
                you need to got into the <a href="about:config">about:config</a> and look for
                <code>media.gmp-widevinecdm.enabled</code> and <code>media.gmp-widevinecdm.visible</code>
                and set both to <code>false</code>. Once you've done that, the notification shouldn't appear again.<br>
                <img src="media/images/firefox_DRM_reminder.png" alt="Screenshot of the DRM notification as described above."><br>
                Tested in <code>Firefox 110.0 (64-bit)</code>.

            <h2>All-In-One HTML file website without js</h2>
            <p class="content">
                I hate going to random websites just to have to click through uMatrix and enable javascript.
                It's messy, it's sketchy, I hate it.
                Because js feels awful for me as a user, I wanted to have my website written in just HTML and CSS,
                but also don't have multiple .html files for each category that have to be loaded when using the navigation menu.
                Luckily, thanks to
                <a title="Blog post for JS-less Navigation menu" href="https://dev.to/hakash/100-pure-htmlcss-page-navigation---no-javascript-required-2em5">
                    this</a> blog post by Morten Olsrud you can now browse this very useful website without having js doing unknown tareram in the background, you are welcome.
                It was unreasonably hard to find a solution for the navigation menu that didn't involve js.
