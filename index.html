                    I'm a biology student and a nerd. Here I'll post about my hobbies such as
                    general biology but more specifically microbiology and entomology but also
                    linux and programming. I'm by no means professional in any of these topics
                    I just enjoy reading about and tinkering with them.<br>
                    My posts will mostly entail me trying out things and logging my failures.
                    The main point is that logging helps me memorize my knowledge, and I'm an
                    attention-whore.

                <p class="content">
                    I hate going to random websites just to have to click through uMatrix and enable javascript.
                    It's messy, it's sketchy, I hate it.
                    Because js feels awful for me as a user, I wanted to have my website written in just HTML and CSS,
                    but also don't have multiple .html files for each category that have to be loaded when using the navigation menu.
                    Luckily, thanks to
                    <a href="https://dev.to/hakash/100-pure-htmlcss-page-navigation---no-javascript-required-2em5">
                        this</a> blog post by Morten Olsrud you can now browse this very useful website without having js doing unknown tareram in the background, you are welcome.
                    It was unreasonably hard to find a solution for the navigation menu that didn't involve js.
